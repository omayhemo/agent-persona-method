## Notes for Implementing Agent

1. **Quality Over Speed**: Take time to create comprehensive stories
2. **Reference Enhanced Stories**: Use 1.1-1.4 and 1.7 as quality benchmarks
3. **Include Real Code**: Don't use placeholders - write actual implementation
4. **Test Your Examples**: Ensure code snippets are syntactically correct
5. **Think Like a Developer**: What would you need to implement this?
