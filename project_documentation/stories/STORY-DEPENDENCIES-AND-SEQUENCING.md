## Sequencing Strategies

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Path
1. **Week 1**: Complete 1.5 (Persistence)
2. **Week 2**: Complete 1.6 (Hooks) + 1.8 (Tracking)
3. **Week 3**: Complete 1.9 (Testing)
4. **Week 4**: Release MVP with basic dev integration

**MVP Features**:
- Basic task extraction
- TodoWrite integration
- Persistence to CLAUDE.md
- Simple progress tracking

### Full Implementation Path

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Already completed: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.7

#### Phase 2: Core Systems (Weeks 3-4)
Priority Order:
1. **1.5** - Persistence (Monday-Tuesday)
2. **1.6** - Hooks (Wednesday-Thursday)
3. **1.8** - Tracking (Friday-Monday)
4. **1.9** - Testing (Tuesday-Wednesday)

#### Phase 3: Agent Integration (Weeks 5-6)
Parallel Execution:
- Developer A: **1.10** - QA Integration
- Developer B: **1.11** - Architect Integration
- Both: **1.12** - Cross-Agent Visibility

#### Phase 4: Polish (Weeks 7-8)
Sequential:
1. **1.13** - Documentation (capture learnings)
2. **1.14** - Training (enable adoption)
3. **1.15** - Performance (ensure scalability)

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **1.5 → Everything**: Persistence failure blocks all progress
   - Mitigation: Implement simple file-based backup first
   
2. **1.6 → 1.8**: Hook system complexity could delay tracking
   - Mitigation: Start with basic event system, enhance later

3. **1.12 Complexity**: Integrating multiple agents is challenging
   - Mitigation: Start with 2-agent visibility, expand gradually

### Contingency Plans

#### If Persistence (1.5) is Delayed:
- Use simple JSON file storage
- Implement in-memory cache
- Defer advanced features

#### If Parallel Execution (1.2 patterns) Fails:
- Fall back to sequential processing
- Implement basic concurrency limits
- Optimize later in 1.15

#### If Hook System (1.6) is Complex:
- Start with hardcoded integration points
- Add dynamic registration later
- Focus on critical paths only
