## Quick Start for Developers

1. Start with **STORY-001** to understand TodoWrite capabilities
2. Review the **[Epic Document](../epics/epic-subtask-integration.md)** for context
3. Check the **[Integration Plan](../subtask-plan.md)** for detailed architecture
4. Follow story dependencies - some stories require others to complete first

## Story Status Legend

- **Ready for Development**: All prerequisites met, can start immediately
- **Blocked**: Waiting on dependent stories
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Completed**: Finished and tested

## Development Guidelines

1. Each story should be completed within its designated sprint
2. Update story status in this index when starting/completing work
3. Create feature branches named: `feature/STORY-XXX-brief-description`
4. Link PRs to story documents
5. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met before marking complete
