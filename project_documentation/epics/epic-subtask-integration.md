# Epic: AP Method Subtask Integration

**Epic ID:** EPIC-001
**Epic Title:** Integrate Claude Code Task Management Features into AP Method
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planning
**Estimated Duration:** 10 weeks
**Owner:** Development Team

## Epic Overview

Enhance the AP Method framework by integrating Claude Code's native task management capabilities (TodoWrite tool and Task tool with subagents) to provide dynamic, real-time task tracking while maintaining the document-driven approach that makes AP Method effective.

## Business Value

- **Enhanced Visibility**: Real-time progress tracking across all agent personas
- **Improved Efficiency**: 30-40% reduction in delivery time through parallel execution
- **Better Quality**: Automated task completion verification reduces missed requirements
- **Seamless Handoffs**: Clear task status prevents work duplication and gaps
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Metrics enable continuous process optimization

## Success Criteria

1. TodoWrite tool successfully integrated with Developer persona workflow
2. Task extraction from story documents automated with 95% accuracy
3. Parallel execution reduces multi-file operations by 40%
4. Session persistence maintains full task context across restarts
5. All agent personas updated with task management capabilities
6. Zero data loss during task state transitions

## Technical Requirements

- Claude Code with TodoWrite and Task tool access
- Hook system for event interception
- CLAUDE.md for persistent storage
- Obsidian MCP for session notes integration

## Dependencies

- Claude Code documentation access
- Test environment for tool experimentation
- Access to all AP Method agent configurations

## Risks

1. **Tool Limitations**: TodoWrite may have undocumented constraints
2. **Performance Impact**: Parallel execution could affect system resources
3. **Data Loss**: Task state could be lost during failures
4. **Adoption Resistance**: Users comfortable with current document-based approach
