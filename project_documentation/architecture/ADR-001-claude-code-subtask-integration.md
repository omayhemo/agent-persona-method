# ADR-001: Claude Code Subtask Integration Approach

**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision By:** User & AP Analyst

## Summary

We will implement Claude Code's native Task tool capabilities directly into the AP Method agents, allowing them to spawn parallel subtasks for complex analyses and operations.

## Context

The AP Method currently operates with sequential agent handoffs and manual task execution. Claude Code offers a powerful Task tool that enables:
- Parallel execution of up to 10 concurrent subagents
- Independent context windows for each subagent
- Full tool access for subtasks (except spawning more tasks)
- Black box operation with results returned upon completion

## Decision

**We will implement Approach 1: Direct Claude Code Task Tool Integration**

This approach involves:
1. Enhancing AP task templates with subtask delegation patterns
2. Updating agent personas to leverage the Task tool
3. Creating standardized subtask templates
4. Defining result synthesis patterns

We explicitly chose NOT to implement:
- Approach 2 (Hybrid with Python Task Manager) - too complex for initial implementation
- Custom subtask infrastructure - unnecessary given Claude's native capabilities

## Rationale

1. **Simplicity First**: No new infrastructure needed; leverages Claude's native capabilities
2. **Fast Validation**: Can quickly test and learn usage patterns
3. **Low Risk**: Easy to pivot if tracking needs emerge
4. **Immediate Value**: Agents can start using parallel processing immediately

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)
1. Create subtask template directory: `agents/tasks/subtasks/`
2. Define standard subtask patterns for common operations
3. Update one agent persona (Architect) as proof of concept

### Phase 2: Rollout (Next Sprint)
1. Update remaining agent personas with subtask capabilities
2. Create result synthesis templates
3. Document best practices from initial usage

### Phase 3: Evolution (Future)
1. Evaluate need for tracking/monitoring
2. Consider hybrid approach if persistent tracking required
3. Gather metrics on subtask usage patterns

## Consequences

### Positive
- Immediate parallel processing capability for all agents
- No infrastructure overhead
- Maintains simplicity of AP Method
- Easy to understand and implement

### Negative
- No persistent tracking of subtasks
- Limited visibility into subtask progress
- Results exist only in conversation context
- No built-in metrics or monitoring

### Mitigation
- Start simple, evolve based on actual needs
- Use conversation logs for initial "tracking"
- Build monitoring only if proven necessary

## Future Considerations

If we need more sophisticated tracking, we can evolve to the Hybrid Approach which would add:
- Python Task Manager integration
- Persistent task history
- Performance metrics
- APM integration

The current approach does not preclude this evolution.
