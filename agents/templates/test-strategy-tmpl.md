### Testing Priorities

- **Critical (P0):** {Core functionality that must work for product viability}
- **High (P1):** {Important features that significantly impact user experience}
- **Medium (P2):** {Standard features with moderate impact}
- **Low (P3):** {Nice-to-have features with minimal impact}
