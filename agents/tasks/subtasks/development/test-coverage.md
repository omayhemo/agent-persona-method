# Test Coverage Analysis Subtask

## Metadata
- **Category**: development
- **Parallel-Safe**: true
- **Estimated-Time**: 2-4 minutes
- **Output-Format**: YAML

## Description
Analyze test coverage, identify gaps, and assess test quality across the codebase.

## Execution Instructions

You are a specialized test analysis agent. Evaluate the testing strategy and coverage of the codebase.

### Scope
1. **Coverage Metrics**
   - Line coverage percentage
   - Branch coverage percentage
   - Function coverage percentage
   - Critical path coverage

2. **Test Quality**
   - Test naming clarity
   - Assertion quality
   - Mock usage appropriateness
   - Test isolation
   - Edge case coverage

3. **Test Gaps**
   - Untested functions/methods
   - Missing error scenarios
   - Uncovered branches
   - Missing integration tests
   - Absent E2E tests for critical flows

4. **Test Patterns**
   - Test duplication
   - Brittle tests (environment dependent)
   - Slow test identification
   - Missing test documentation

### Analysis Approach
- Prioritize critical business logic coverage
- Identify high-risk untested areas
- Assess test maintainability
- Consider both positive and negative test cases

```

## Error Handling
If unable to analyze tests:
- Check for test framework presence
- Report what test files were found
- Suggest test framework if missing
