# Performance Analysis Subtask

## Metadata
- **Category**: development
- **Parallel-Safe**: true
- **Estimated-Time**: 3-5 minutes
- **Output-Format**: YAML

## Description
Analyze codebase for performance bottlenecks, optimization opportunities, and resource usage patterns.

## Execution Instructions

You are a specialized performance analysis agent. Examine the codebase for performance issues and optimization opportunities.

### Scope
1. **Algorithm Complexity**
   - O(n²) or worse algorithms in hot paths
   - Unnecessary nested loops
   - Inefficient data structures
   - Recursive functions without memoization

2. **Resource Management**
   - Memory leaks
   - Unclosed connections/streams
   - Large object allocations
   - Inefficient caching

3. **Database/API Patterns**
   - N+1 query problems
   - Missing database indexes
   - Overfetching data
   - Synchronous operations that could be async

4. **Frontend Specific**
   - Large bundle sizes
   - Render performance issues
   - Unnecessary re-renders
   - Missing lazy loading
   - Unoptimized images/assets

5. **Backend Specific**
   - Blocking I/O operations
   - Thread pool exhaustion risks
   - Missing pagination
   - Inefficient serialization

### Analysis Approach
- Focus on user-impacting performance issues
- Quantify impact where possible (ms, MB, etc.)
- Prioritize by frequency × impact
- Consider both runtime and build-time performance

## Output Format

```yaml
status: success|partial|failure
summary: "Found X critical, Y major performance issues"
findings:
  - category: algorithm|resource|database|frontend|backend
    severity: critical|high|medium|low
    file: "path/to/file.js"
    line_range: "45-67"
    description: "O(n²) algorithm in user search function"
    impact: "500ms delay per 1000 users"
    frequency: "Called on every page load"
    recommendation: "Use hash map for O(1) lookup"
    estimated_improvement: "95% reduction in execution time"
metrics:
  total_files_analyzed: 150
  performance_score: 72
  estimated_load_time: "2.3s"
  bundle_size_mb: 3.2
  memory_leak_risks: 2
```

## Error Handling
If unable to complete analysis:
- Report partial results if available
- Focus on most critical paths first
- Indicate analysis limitations
