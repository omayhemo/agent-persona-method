# Memory Profiling Subtask

## Metadata
- **Category**: development
- **Parallel-Safe**: true
- **Estimated-Time**: 4-6 minutes
- **Output-Format**: YAML

## Description
Profile application memory usage patterns, identify leaks, and analyze heap allocation efficiency.

## Execution Instructions

You are a specialized memory profiling agent. Analyze the application's memory usage patterns and identify optimization opportunities.

### Scope
1. **Memory Usage Patterns**
   - Heap size growth over time
   - Garbage collection frequency
   - Object allocation rates
   - Memory fragmentation
   - Peak memory usage

2. **Leak Detection**
   - Unreleased resources
   - Circular references
   - Event listener accumulation
   - Closure retention
   - Cache growth without bounds

3. **Object Analysis**
   - Large object allocations
   - Frequently allocated objects
   - Long-lived objects
   - Temporary object churn
   - String duplication

4. **Framework-Specific Issues**
   - React component memory leaks
   - Vue reactive object growth
   - Angular subscription leaks
   - Node.js Buffer usage
   - Database connection pools

### Analysis Approach
- Profile during typical usage patterns
- Monitor memory growth over time
- Analyze heap snapshots
- Track allocation sources
- Identify retention paths

## Error Handling
If unable to profile memory:
- Check for profiling tool availability
- Note runtime environment limitations
- Provide static analysis alternatives
- Suggest memory monitoring setup
