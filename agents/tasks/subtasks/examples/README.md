# Parallel Subtask Examples

This directory contains real-world examples of parallel subtask execution and their synthesized results.

## Available Examples

### 1. Python Task Manager Review
**File**: `python-task-manager-review.yaml`
**Description**: Comprehensive code review of the AP Method's Python task manager using 5 parallel subtasks.

**Tasks Executed**:
- Security vulnerability scan
- Performance analysis
- Test coverage audit
- Code complexity check
- Dependency audit

**Key Findings**:
- Overall Score: 58/100
- 0% test coverage (critical issue)
- N+1 query problems
- High complexity functions
- All dependencies secure

**Demonstrates**:
- How multiple perspectives reveal different issues
- Code Review Aggregator synthesis pattern
- Prioritized action items with time estimates

### 2. Cross-Browser Test Results (Coming Soon)
**File**: `cross-browser-compatibility-test.yaml`
**Description**: Browser compatibility testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.

**Demonstrates**:
- Consensus Builder pattern for conflicting results
- Platform-specific issue tracking
- Visual regression detection

### 3. Security Audit Results (Coming Soon)
**File**: `security-audit-comprehensive.yaml`
**Description**: Multi-layer security assessment combining automated and manual findings.

**Demonstrates**:
- Risk Matrix pattern for security prioritization
- Vulnerability chain analysis
- Compliance impact assessment

### 4. Performance Regression Analysis (Coming Soon)
**File**: `performance-regression-v2.1.yaml`
**Description**: Performance comparison between releases.

**Demonstrates**:
- Performance Baseline Comparator pattern
- Regression detection and root cause analysis
- Rollback decision support
