# PO Sprint Capacity Optimizer Synthesis Pattern

## Purpose
Balance sprint workload across teams, optimize resource utilization, and ensure sustainable pace while maximizing value delivery.

## When to Use
- After story sizing and team capacity analysis
- During sprint planning
- When rebalancing work mid-sprint
- For capacity forecasting

## Input Format
Expects sprint allocations, team capacity data, story assignments, and skill requirements.

## Optimization Algorithm

```python
# Multi-objective optimization for sprint capacity
def optimize_sprint_capacity(sprints, teams, stories, constraints):
    # 1. Calculate base capacity
    capacity = calculate_team_capacity(teams, sprints)
    
    # 2. Apply constraints
    capacity = apply_constraints(capacity, holidays, training)
    
    # 3. Optimize allocation
    allocation = initialize_allocation()
    
    for iteration in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
        # Evaluate current allocation
        metrics = evaluate_allocation(allocation, capacity)
        
        # Multi-objective optimization
        if metrics.all_constraints_met():
            break
            
        # Adjust allocation
        allocation = adjust_allocation(
            allocation,
            metrics,
            priorities=['value', 'balance', 'risk']
        )
    
    # 4. Generate recommendations
    recommendations = generate_optimization_insights(
        allocation, metrics, capacity
    )
    
    return allocation, recommendations
```

## Advanced Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Value Stream Mapping**
- Identify value flow through sprints
- Optimize for early delivery
- Remove bottlenecks

### 2. **Resource Leveling**
- Smooth workload peaks
- Prevent team burnout
- Maintain consistent velocity

### 3. **Risk Balancing**
- Distribute complex work
- Avoid risk concentration
- Build in buffers strategically

## Quality Thresholds
- **Utilization**: 80-90% optimal
- **Variance**: <15% between teams
- **Risk**: Distributed evenly
- **Value**: Front-loaded delivery

## Example Usage
Best for: Sprint planning, resource management, capacity planning, portfolio optimization
