# PO Business Value Maximizer Synthesis Pattern

## Purpose
Prioritize backlog items to maximize business value delivery, ROI, and strategic alignment while respecting constraints.

## When to Use
- During backlog prioritization
- For release planning
- When making trade-off decisions
- During portfolio optimization

## Input Format
Expects business value scores, ROI calculations, strategic alignment data, and constraint information.

## Maximization Algorithm

```python
# Multi-criteria value maximization
def maximize_business_value(items, constraints, objectives):
    # 1. Calculate composite value scores
    for item in items:
        item.composite_score = calculate_composite_value(
            item,
            weights={
                'roi': 0.3,
                'strategic_alignment': 0.25,
                'user_impact': 0.25,
                'risk_reduction': 0.15,
                'technical_enablement': 0.05
            }
        )
    
    # 2. Apply constraint satisfaction
    feasible_items = apply_constraints(
        items,
        constraints={
            'capacity': team_capacity,
            'dependencies': dependency_graph,
            'deadlines': compliance_dates,
            'budget': available_budget
        }
    )
    
    # 3. Optimize selection (knapsack variant)
    selected = optimize_portfolio(
        feasible_items,
        objectives={
            'maximize_value': True,
            'minimize_risk': True,
            'balance_portfolio': True
        }
    )
    
    # 4. Generate trade-off analysis
    alternatives = generate_alternatives(selected, items)
    
    return selected, alternatives, insights
```

## Value Calculation Framework

### 1. **ROI Components**
```yaml
roi_calculation:
  revenue_impact:
    direct_revenue: "New sales, upgrades"
    indirect_revenue: "Retention, referrals"
    
  cost_savings:
    operational: "Automation, efficiency"
    support: "Reduced tickets, issues"
    
  investment:
    development: "Team hours Ã— rate"
    infrastructure: "Services, tools"
    opportunity: "Other work foregone"
```

### 2. **Strategic Value Multipliers**
- Market differentiation: 1.5x
- Competitive parity: 1.0x
- Technical debt: 0.8x
- Innovation: 1.3x

### 3. **Time Value Factors**
- Immediate need: 1.5x
- This quarter: 1.2x
- This year: 1.0x
- Future: 0.7x
