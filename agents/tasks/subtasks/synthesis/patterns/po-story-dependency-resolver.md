# PO Story Dependency Resolver Synthesis Pattern

## Purpose
Optimize story sequencing by resolving dependencies, identifying parallel opportunities, and creating an executable development order.

## When to Use
- After story breakdown and dependency mapping
- Before sprint allocation
- When optimizing for parallel development
- During release planning

## Input Format
Expects story definitions with dependencies, technical requirements, and team assignments.

## Resolution Algorithm

```python
# Dependency resolution using topological sort with parallelization
def resolve_story_dependencies(stories, dependencies):
    # 1. Build dependency graph
    graph = build_dependency_graph(stories, dependencies)
    
    # 2. Detect circular dependencies
    cycles = detect_cycles(graph)
    if cycles:
        resolve_cycles(cycles)
    
    # 3. Calculate levels (parallel groups)
    levels = []
    remaining = set(stories)
    
    while remaining:
        # Find stories with no pending dependencies
        available = find_available_stories(remaining, graph)
        if not available:
            handle_deadlock(remaining)
        
        levels.append(available)
        remaining -= available
        update_graph(graph, available)
    
    # 4. Optimize within levels
    for level in levels:
        optimize_level_assignment(level, teams)
    
    return levels, optimization_report
```

## Resolution Strategies

### 1. **Dependency Types Priority**
```yaml
dependency_priorities:
  blocking: 1.0      # Must complete first
  data: 0.8         # Schema/model dependencies
  integration: 0.6  # API contracts
  soft: 0.3        # Preferred order
  optional: 0.1    # Nice to have
```

### 2. **Cycle Resolution**
- Identify minimal breaking point
- Convert to soft dependency
- Introduce interface/mock
- Split story if necessary

### 3. **Parallelization Rules**
- Group independent stories
- Balance team workload
- Minimize context switching
- Respect skill requirements
