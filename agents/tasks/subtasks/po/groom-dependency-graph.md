# Dependency Graph Generation Subtask

## Purpose
Build comprehensive dependency graph from all stories to enable optimal sprint planning.

## Input
- Complete story list with dependencies
- Epic relationships
- Technical constraints
- External system dependencies

## Processing Steps
1. Parse all story dependencies
2. Identify dependency types (blocking, soft, optional)
3. Detect circular dependencies
4. Calculate critical path
5. Identify parallelizable work streams
6. Generate visual representation

## Output Format
```yaml
dependency_graph:
  nodes:
    - id: "STORY-001"
      type: "story"
      epic: "EPIC-001"
      dependencies:
        blocking: ["STORY-002"]
        soft: ["STORY-005"]
        optional: []
  
  critical_path:
    - "STORY-002"
    - "STORY-001"
    - "STORY-004"
    
  parallel_streams:
    - stream_id: "frontend"
      stories: ["STORY-010", "STORY-011", "STORY-012"]
      can_start: "immediately"
    - stream_id: "backend-auth"
      stories: ["STORY-001", "STORY-002", "STORY-003"]
      can_start: "immediately"

    graph TD
      STORY-002[Database Schema] --> STORY-001[JWT Service]
      STORY-001 --> STORY-004[Auth Endpoint]
      STORY-010[React Setup] -.-> STORY-011[Component Library]
      STORY-011 -.-> STORY-012[Login Form]
```

## Dependency Types
- **Blocking**: Must complete before starting
- **Soft**: Preferred to complete first but not required
- **Optional**: Nice to have completed first

## Quality Checks
- No circular dependencies exist
- All story references are valid
- Critical path is accurate
- Parallel streams are truly independent
