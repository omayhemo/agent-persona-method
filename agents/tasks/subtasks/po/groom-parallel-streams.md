# Parallel Work Stream Identification Subtask

## Purpose
Identify opportunities for parallel development by analyzing dependencies and team capabilities.

## Input
- Dependency graph
- Team structure and skills
- Story technical requirements
- Resource availability
- Infrastructure constraints

## Processing Steps
1. Analyze dependency graph for independent paths
2. Group stories by technical domain
3. Map team capabilities to work streams
4. Identify resource conflicts
5. Optimize for maximum parallelization
6. Define synchronization points

## Stream Independence Levels
- **VERY_HIGH**: No dependencies on other streams
- **HIGH**: Minimal dependencies, can mock/stub
- **MEDIUM**: Some dependencies, needs coordination
- **LOW**: Significant dependencies, limited parallelism

## Synchronization Types
- **Hard Sync**: Must complete before proceeding
- **Soft Sync**: Preferred but not blocking
- **Milestone Sync**: Major integration points
- **Continuous Sync**: Ongoing coordination

## Quality Checks
- No resource over-allocation
- Dependencies properly sequenced
- Synchronization points realistic
- Team skills match stream needs
- Efficiency metrics calculated
