## Checklist Execution Guidelines

### Checklist Item Evaluation
- **Pass (✓):** Item meets all criteria with evidence
- **Fail (✗):** Item does not meet criteria or has issues
- **N/A:** Item not applicable to current context
- **Partial (△):** Item partially meets criteria but needs attention

### Evidence Requirements
- **Objective Verification:** Provide measurable evidence where possible
- **Documentation:** Link to relevant documents, test results, or artifacts
- **Screenshots/Logs:** Include visual evidence for UI or system verification
- **Test Results:** Reference specific test cases or validation procedures

### Risk-Based Prioritization
- **Critical:** Must be resolved before progression (blocking issues)
- **Major:** Should be resolved soon (quality/functionality impact)
- **Minor:** Can be addressed in future iterations (cosmetic/low impact)
