## Best Practices

### Writing Effective User Stories

1. **Focus on User Value:** Always articulate clear user or business benefit
2. **Keep Stories Independent:** Minimize dependencies between stories
3. **Make Stories Testable:** Ensure acceptance criteria are specific and verifiable
4. **Size Appropriately:** Stories should be completable within one sprint
5. **Use Plain Language:** Avoid technical jargon in user-facing story descriptions

### Story Content Guidelines

1. **Specific Users:** Define specific user roles rather than generic "user"
2. **Clear Goals:** Make user goals actionable and specific
3. **Obvious Benefits:** Ensure the value is clear and compelling
4. **Complete Scenarios:** Cover the full user workflow within the story
5. **Quality Criteria:** Include non-functional requirements where important

### Common Story Creation Pitfalls

1. **Too Large:** Stories that span multiple sprints or epics
2. **Too Technical:** Stories written from system perspective rather than user
3. **Missing Context:** Stories without sufficient business or technical context
4. **Poor Acceptance Criteria:** Vague or incomplete criteria that can't be tested
5. **No Clear Value:** Stories where user benefit is unclear or questionable

### Quality Indicators

- Stories follow consistent format and structure
- Each story delivers clear, independent value
- Acceptance criteria are comprehensive and testable
- Dependencies are identified and managed
- Stories align with business objectives and user needs
