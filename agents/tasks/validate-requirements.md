# Validate Requirements Task

## Purpose

To systematically review and validate project requirements (PRD, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria) for completeness, testability, and quality assurance readiness before development begins.

## Inputs for this Task

- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Epic definitions and user stories
- Acceptance criteria for all stories
- Architecture documents (main and frontend if applicable)
- Any existing project constraints or technical assumptions

## Task Execution Instructions

### 1. PRD Quality Assessment

- **Completeness Review:**
  - [ ] All functional requirements clearly defined
  - [ ] Non-functional requirements specified with measurable criteria
  - [ ] User personas and target audience well-defined
  - [ ] Success metrics and KPIs identified
  - [ ] Out-of-scope items clearly documented
- **Clarity & Consistency:**
  - [ ] Requirements use consistent terminology throughout
  - [ ] No conflicting or contradictory requirements
  - [ ] Technical assumptions are realistic and feasible
  - [ ] Business rules and constraints clearly stated
- **Testability Assessment:**
  - [ ] Each requirement can be objectively verified
  - [ ] Success criteria are measurable and specific
  - [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios considered
  - [ ] Performance requirements include specific thresholds

### 2. Epic & User Story Validation

- **Story Quality Review:**
  - [ ] Each story follows proper user story format (As a... I want... So that...)
  - [ ] Stories are independent and can be developed/tested separately
  - [ ] Stories are appropriately sized (not too large or too small)
  - [ ] Stories provide clear business value
  - [ ] Story dependencies are identified and manageable
- **Epic Coherence:**
  - [ ] Epics represent logical groupings of related functionality
  - [ ] Epic sequence supports incremental value delivery
  - [ ] Epic goals align with overall project objectives
  - [ ] Epic scope is appropriate for development capacity

### 3. Acceptance Criteria Assessment

- **Criteria Completeness:**
  - [ ] All stories have comprehensive acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Criteria cover happy path scenarios
  - [ ] Error conditions and edge cases addressed
  - [ ] Integration points and dependencies specified
  - [ ] Performance and usability requirements included where relevant
- **Criteria Quality:**
  - [ ] Criteria are specific and unambiguous
  - [ ] Criteria are testable and verifiable
  - [ ] Criteria include both positive and negative test scenarios
  - [ ] Criteria specify expected system behavior clearly
  - [ ] Data validation and security requirements included

### 4. Cross-Reference Validation

- **Requirement Traceability:**
  - [ ] All PRD requirements map to specific epics/stories
  - [ ] No orphaned or missing requirements
  - [ ] Acceptance criteria support higher-level requirements
  - [ ] Architecture supports all specified requirements
- **Consistency Check:**
  - [ ] User stories align with defined user personas
  - [ ] Technical requirements match architectural capabilities
  - [ ] UI/UX requirements are feasible within technical constraints
  - [ ] Timeline expectations are realistic given scope

### 5. Risk & Quality Assessment

- **Quality Risk Identification:**
  - [ ] Complex or high-risk functionality identified
  - [ ] Areas requiring specialized testing approaches noted
  - [ ] Integration points that need extra attention marked
  - [ ] Performance-critical paths highlighted
  - [ ] Security-sensitive operations flagged
- **Testing Readiness:**
  - [ ] Requirements provide sufficient detail for test case creation
  - [ ] Test data requirements can be determined from requirements
  - [ ] Environment needs are clear from specifications
  - [ ] Automation opportunities identified

### 6. Stakeholder Alignment

- **Review Process:**
  - Present findings to PM, Architect, and PO
  - Discuss any gaps, ambiguities, or concerns identified
  - Collaborate on resolution of requirement issues
  - Ensure all stakeholders understand testing implications
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Work with PM to refine unclear requirements
  - Support story refinement and acceptance criteria improvement
  - Update requirements based on QA review findings
  - Document any assumptions or clarifications made

### 7. Create Validation Report

Generate a comprehensive validation report including:

- **Summary of Findings:** Overall assessment of requirement quality
- **Identified Issues:** Specific problems with recommendations
- **Risk Assessment:** Quality risks and mitigation suggestions
- **Testing Readiness:** Assessment of readiness for test planning
- **Recommendations:** Specific actions to improve requirement quality
- **Sign-off Status:** Approval status and any conditions

## Validation Criteria Checklist

- [ ] **Clear:** Unambiguous and specific language used
- [ ] **Consistent:** No contradictions or conflicts
- [ ] **Testable:** Can be objectively verified
- [ ] **Feasible:** Technically and practically achievable

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Performance:** Specific response time, throughput, and scalability targets
- [ ] **Security:** Authentication, authorization, and data protection requirements
- [ ] **Usability:** User experience and accessibility standards
- [ ] **Reliability:** Uptime, availability, and error recovery expectations
- [ ] **Compatibility:** Browser, device, and platform support specifications

### User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
