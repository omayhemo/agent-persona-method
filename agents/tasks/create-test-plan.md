# Create Test Plan Task

## Purpose

To develop detailed test plans for specific epics, features, or project phases based on the established test strategy and validated requirements. This task creates actionable testing roadmaps with specific test cases, scenarios, and execution guidance.

## Inputs for this Task

- **Set Plan Objectives:**
  - Primary testing goals and success criteria
  - Quality gates and exit criteria
  - Risk mitigation objectives
  - Coverage targets and metrics

### 2. Analyze Test Requirements

- **Functional Testing Requirements:**
  - Extract testable requirements from user stories
  - Identify positive and negative test scenarios
  - Map user journeys and workflows
  - Define data validation and business rule tests
- **Non-Functional Testing Requirements:**
  - Performance testing needs and benchmarks
  - Security testing requirements
  - Accessibility testing criteria
  - Compatibility testing matrix
- **Integration Testing Requirements:**
  - API testing scenarios and data contracts
  - Third-party service integration tests
  - Database interaction testing
  - Cross-component integration scenarios

### 3. Design Test Cases & Scenarios

- **Functional Test Cases:**
  ```
  Test Case ID: TC_[Feature]_[Number]
  Test Case Name: [Descriptive name]
  Objective: [What this test validates]
  Preconditions: [Setup requirements]
  Test Steps: [Detailed step-by-step procedure]
  Expected Results: [Expected behavior/outcome]
  Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
  Category: [Functional/Integration/UI/etc.]
  ```
- **Test Scenario Categories:**
  - Happy path scenarios (normal user workflows)
  - Edge cases and boundary conditions
  - Error handling and validation scenarios
  - Security and permission testing
  - Performance and load scenarios
- **Test Data Requirements:**
  - Identify required test data sets
  - Define data creation and cleanup procedures
  - Document data privacy and security considerations
  - Plan for data variability and edge cases

### 4. Plan Test Execution Strategy

- **Test Environment Requirements:**
  - Development/staging environment specifications
  - Test data setup and configuration
  - Browser and device testing matrix
  - Integration with external services (mocks vs. real)
- **Test Execution Approach:**
  - Manual testing procedures and guidelines
  - Automated testing implementation plan
  - Regression testing strategy
  - Exploratory testing guidelines
- **Test Scheduling & Sequencing:**
  - Test execution timeline aligned with development
  - Dependencies between test phases
  - Parallel vs. sequential testing opportunities
  - Resource allocation and assignments

### 5. Define Quality Gates & Criteria

- **Entry Criteria:**
  - Code completion and unit test coverage thresholds
  - Environment readiness and data availability
  - Build stability and deployment success
  - Documentation and test case completion
- **Exit Criteria:**
  - Test execution completion rates
  - Defect closure and severity thresholds
  - Performance benchmark achievement
  - Stakeholder acceptance and sign-off
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Test coverage percentages
  - Defect detection and resolution rates
  - Performance and reliability measurements
  - User acceptance criteria fulfillment

### 6. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

- **Testing Risks:**
  - Environment availability and stability
  - Test data quality and availability
  - Resource constraints and timeline pressures
  - Technical complexity and unknown factors
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Contingency plans for identified risks
  - Alternative testing approaches
  - Resource backup and escalation procedures
  - Risk monitoring and early warning indicators

### 7. Document Test Plan

Using the `test-plan-tmpl` template (found in `templates#test-plan-tmpl`), create a comprehensive document including:

- **Test Plan Overview:** Scope, objectives, and approach summary
- **Test Strategy Reference:** Alignment with overall testing strategy
- **Test Cases & Scenarios:** Detailed test case specifications
- **Execution Plan:** Timeline, resources, and procedures
- **Environment & Data:** Setup requirements and procedures
- **Quality Gates:** Entry/exit criteria and success metrics
- **Risk Management:** Identified risks and mitigation plans
- **Deliverables:** Expected outputs and documentation

### 8. Review & Validation

- **Technical Review:**
  - Validate test cases cover all requirements
  - Ensure test scenarios address identified risks
  - Verify test data and environment feasibility
  - Confirm resource and timeline viability
- **Stakeholder Approval:**
  - Present test plan to PM, developers, and PO
  - Gather feedback on coverage and approach
  - Adjust plan based on team input and constraints
  - Obtain formal approval to proceed with execution

## Test Case Design Guidelines

### Effective Test Case Characteristics
- **Clear and Specific:** Unambiguous steps and expected results
- **Repeatable:** Can be executed consistently by different testers
- **Independent:** Not dependent on other test cases for success
- **Traceable:** Clearly linked to specific requirements
- **Maintainable:** Easy to update as requirements evolve

### Test Case Prioritization
- **High Priority:** Critical functionality, high-risk areas, core user journeys
- **Medium Priority:** Important features, moderate risk, secondary workflows
- **Low Priority:** Nice-to-have features, low risk, edge cases

### Test Data Strategy
- **Realistic Data:** Mirrors production data characteristics
- **Edge Cases:** Boundary values, empty/null data, maximum limits
- **Invalid Data:** Malformed inputs, unauthorized access attempts
- **Volume Testing:** Large data sets for performance validation

## Output Deliverables

- **Detailed Test Plan Document** (following `test-plan-tmpl`)
- **Test Case Specifications** with full traceability to requirements
- **Test Data Requirements** and creation procedures
- **Environment Setup Guide** with configuration details
- **Execution Timeline** integrated with development schedule
- **Risk Mitigation Plan** with specific countermeasures

## Success Criteria

The test plan is complete when:

1. All requirements have corresponding test cases with full traceability
2. Test scenarios cover functional, non-functional, and integration testing needs
3. Quality gates and success criteria are clearly defined and measurable
4. Resource requirements and timeline are realistic and approved
5. Risks are identified with appropriate mitigation strategies
6. Stakeholders have reviewed and approved the plan
7. Test execution can proceed with clear guidance and expectations
