## Quick Start

### The Golden Rule

**🚨 CRITICAL**: ALL Task tool invocations MUST be in a SINGLE response for parallel execution.

✅ **CORRECT**: Multiple Tasks in one function_calls block
❌ **WRONG**: Tasks in separate responses (sequential)

### Basic Pattern

```
I'll analyze your system using parallel subtasks.

*Spawning parallel analysis tasks:*
[All Task invocations in ONE function_calls block]
- Task 1: Security scan
- Task 2: Performance check
- Task 3: Code quality analysis

*After all complete, applying synthesis pattern...*
```

## Developer Persona Examples

### Example 1: Comprehensive Code Review

4. Database performance test
5. CDN/Cache effectiveness test

Synthesis Pattern: Performance Baseline Comparator

Load Test Results:
- Normal Load (1K users): ✅ All metrics green
- 3x Peak (3K users): ⚠️ Response time +40%
- 10x Spike (10K users): ❌ System degradation

Breaking Points:
- API Gateway: 8K requests/second
- Database: Connection pool exhausted at 5K users
- Application: Memory pressure at 7K users

Recommendations:
1. Increase DB connection pool (100 → 200)
2. Implement API request queuing
3. Add 2 more application instances
4. Enable auto-scaling at 70% capacity
```

```

### Pattern 2: The 360° Review
**When to use**: Comprehensive analysis of a component

```yaml
Tasks:
- Code quality analysis
- Security assessment
- Performance profiling
- Test coverage check
- Documentation review

Synthesis: Impact Analyzer
Output: Prioritized issues with business impact
```

### Pattern 3: The Comparison Study
**When to use**: Evaluating changes against baseline

```yaml
Tasks:
- Current version analysis
- Previous version analysis
- Performance comparison
- Feature comparison

Synthesis: Performance Baseline Comparator
Output: Delta analysis with regression detection
```

## Synthesis Pattern Selection

## Best Practices

### 1. Task Selection
- **Limit to 5-7 tasks** for optimal performance
- **Ensure independence** - tasks shouldn't depend on each other
- **Balance coverage** - mix different analysis types
- **Consider time** - all tasks should complete in similar timeframes

### 2. Result Interpretation
- **Check confidence scores** - higher confidence = more reliable
- **Look for consensus** - multiple tools finding same issue
- **Consider context** - some issues may be intentional
- **Verify critical findings** - manual check for high-impact issues

### 3. Action Planning
- **Start with critical** - security and data integrity first
- **Quick wins next** - high impact, low effort items
- **Batch related fixes** - group similar changes
- **Track progress** - use task management for findings

### 4. Team Collaboration
- **Share reports** - export findings for team review
- **Document decisions** - why certain issues were deferred
- **Update baselines** - after fixes, re-run for new baseline
- **Learn patterns** - identify recurring issue types

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tasks Running Sequentially

**Symptom**: Tasks complete one after another, taking 25+ minutes

**Solution**: Ensure ALL Task invocations are in a single response:
```python
# WRONG - Sequential
response1: Task(security_scan)
response2: Task(performance_check)

# CORRECT - Parallel
response1: 
  Task(security_scan)
  Task(performance_check)
```

### Issue: Inconsistent Results

**Symptom**: Different results each run

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Environment differences** - ensure consistent test environment
2. **Timing issues** - some issues are intermittent
3. **Data variations** - use consistent test data
4. **Tool limitations** - understand each tool's accuracy

### Issue: Synthesis Pattern Mismatch

**Symptom**: Results don't match expected format

**Solution**: Choose appropriate pattern:
- Multiple test types → Test Coverage Aggregator
- Security findings → Risk Matrix
- Performance issues → Performance Baseline Comparator
- Mixed findings → Code Review Aggregator

### Issue: Too Many Findings

**Symptom**: Overwhelmed by number of issues

**Solution**: Use synthesis patterns that prioritize:
1. **Risk Matrix** - for security/risk prioritization
2. **Priority Ranker** - for effort/impact balance
3. **Impact Analyzer** - for business priority
