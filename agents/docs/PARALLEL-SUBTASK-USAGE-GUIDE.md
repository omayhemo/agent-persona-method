## Quick Start

### The Golden Rule

**üö® CRITICAL**: ALL Task tool invocations MUST be in a SINGLE response for parallel execution.

‚úÖ **CORRECT**: Multiple Tasks in one function_calls block
‚ùå **WRONG**: Tasks in separate responses (sequential)

### Basic Pattern

```
I'll analyze your system using parallel subtasks.

*Spawning parallel analysis tasks:*
[All Task invocations in ONE function_calls block]
- Task 1: Security scan
- Task 2: Performance check
- Task 3: Code quality analysis

*After all complete, applying synthesis pattern...*
```

## Developer Persona Examples

### Example 1: Comprehensive Code Review

**Scenario**: Review a pull request for a payment processing module

**Command**: `/parallel-review payment-service/`

**Execution**:
```yaml
Parallel Tasks Spawned:

- Memory: 3 memory leaks (45MB/hour growth)
- API: p95 response time increased 40%
- Bottleneck: Product search query (2.5s average)

Optimization Priorities:
1. Add index on products.category_id (-95% query time)
2. Fix N+1 in related products (-60% requests)
3. Implement query result caching (-70% load)
```

## QA Persona Examples

### Example 1: Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing

**Scenario**: Validate new checkout flow across browsers

**Command**: `/parallel-test checkout --browsers`

**Execution**:
```yaml
Parallel Tasks Spawned:
1. Chrome browser test
2. Firefox browser test
3. Safari browser test
4. Edge browser test
5. Mobile responsive test

Synthesis Pattern: Consensus Builder

Compatibility Results:
- Unanimous Pass: Login, product selection
- Majority Pass: Payment form (Safari issue)
- Failed: Order confirmation (Safari, Mobile)
- Browser-Specific Issues:
  - Safari: Date picker renders incorrectly
  - Mobile: Buttons too small (< 44px)
  - Edge: Minor CSS alignment issue

Overall Compatibility: 82%
Recommendation: Fix Safari/Mobile before release
```

### Example 2: Comprehensive E2E Testing

**Scenario**: Full user journey testing for critical paths

**Execution**:
```yaml
Parallel Tasks Spawned:
1. User registration journey
2. Product purchase journey
3. Account management journey
4. Search and discovery journey

Synthesis Pattern: Test Coverage Aggregator

Journey Coverage:
- Registration: 95% success (email validation issue)
- Purchase: 78% success (payment timeout)
- Account Mgmt: 92% success (password reset bug)
- Search: 88% success (filter combination error)

Critical Failures:
1. Payment confirmation timeout (22% of attempts)
2. Password reset email not sent (8% of attempts)
3. Search filters reset on pagination

Overall E2E Health: 86%
Customer Impact: HIGH (payment issues)
```

### Example 3: Performance and Load Testing

**Scenario**: Validate system capacity for Black Friday

**Execution**:
```yaml
Parallel Tasks Spawned:
1. Load test - normal traffic
2. Load test - 3x peak
3. Load test - 10x spike
4. Database performance test
5. CDN/Cache effectiveness test

Synthesis Pattern: Performance Baseline Comparator

Load Test Results:
- Normal Load (1K users): ‚úÖ All metrics green
- 3x Peak (3K users): ‚ö†Ô∏è Response time +40%
- 10x Spike (10K users): ‚ùå System degradation

Breaking Points:
- API Gateway: 8K requests/second
- Database: Connection pool exhausted at 5K users
- Application: Memory pressure at 7K users

Recommendations:
1. Increase DB connection pool (100 ‚Üí 200)
2. Implement API request queuing
3. Add 2 more application instances
4. Enable auto-scaling at 70% capacity
```

## Common Patterns

```yaml
Tasks:
- Security validation
- Performance validation
- Functionality validation
- Compatibility validation

Synthesis: Multi-Source Validator
Output: Confidence score with go/no-go decision
```

### Pattern 2: The 360¬∞ Review
**When to use**: Comprehensive analysis of a component

```yaml
Tasks:
- Code quality analysis
- Security assessment
- Performance profiling
- Test coverage check
- Documentation review

Synthesis: Impact Analyzer
Output: Prioritized issues with business impact
```

### Pattern 3: The Comparison Study
**When to use**: Evaluating changes against baseline

```yaml
Tasks:

## Best Practices

### 1. Task Selection
- **Limit to 5-7 tasks** for optimal performance
- **Ensure independence** - tasks shouldn't depend on each other
- **Balance coverage** - mix different analysis types
- **Consider time** - all tasks should complete in similar timeframes

### 2. Result Interpretation
- **Check confidence scores** - higher confidence = more reliable
- **Look for consensus** - multiple tools finding same issue
- **Consider context** - some issues may be intentional
- **Verify critical findings** - manual check for high-impact issues

### 3. Action Planning
- **Start with critical** - security and data integrity first
- **Quick wins next** - high impact, low effort items
- **Batch related fixes** - group similar changes
- **Track progress** - use task management for findings

### 4. Team Collaboration
- **Share reports** - export findings for team review
- **Document decisions** - why certain issues were deferred
- **Update baselines** - after fixes, re-run for new baseline
- **Learn patterns** - identify recurring issue types

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tasks Running Sequentially

**Symptom**: Tasks complete one after another, taking 25+ minutes

**Solution**: Ensure ALL Task invocations are in a single response:
```python
# WRONG - Sequential
response1: Task(security_scan)
response2: Task(performance_check)

# CORRECT - Parallel
response1: 
  Task(security_scan)
  Task(performance_check)
```

### Issue: Inconsistent Results

**Symptom**: Different results each run

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Environment differences** - ensure consistent test environment
2. **Timing issues** - some issues are intermittent
3. **Data variations** - use consistent test data
4. **Tool limitations** - understand each tool's accuracy

### Issue: Synthesis Pattern Mismatch

**Symptom**: Results don't match expected format

**Solution**: Choose appropriate pattern:
- Multiple test types ‚Üí Test Coverage Aggregator
- Security findings ‚Üí Risk Matrix
- Performance issues ‚Üí Performance Baseline Comparator
- Mixed findings ‚Üí Code Review Aggregator

### Issue: Too Many Findings

**Symptom**: Overwhelmed by number of issues

**Solution**: Use synthesis patterns that prioritize:
1. **Risk Matrix** - for security/risk prioritization
2. **Priority Ranker** - for effort/impact balance
3. **Impact Analyzer** - for business priority

## Advanced Usage

### Scheduling Parallel Reviews

Integrate into your workflow:

1. **PR Checks**: Run on every pull request
2. **Nightly Builds**: Comprehensive analysis
3. **Pre-Release**: Full validation suite
4. **Post-Incident**: Root cause analysis
5. **Sprint Reviews**: Technical debt assessment

## Conclusion

Parallel subtasks transform how we analyze and validate code. What previously took hours of sequential analysis now completes in minutes with richer insights. Start with the common patterns, experiment with combinations, and build your own patterns for your team's specific needs.

Remember: **Always invoke all tasks in a single response for true parallel execution!**
