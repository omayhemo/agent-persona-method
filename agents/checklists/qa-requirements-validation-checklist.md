# Requirements Validation Checklist

## Purpose

To systematically validate that project requirements (PRD, user stories, acceptance criteria) are complete, clear, testable, and ready for quality assurance activities.

## Instructions

Review each requirement against these criteria. Mark as: ✅ PASS, ❌ FAIL, ⚠️ PARTIAL, or N/A.

- [ ] Criteria are testable and verifiable objectively
- [ ] Criteria include both positive and negative test scenarios
- [ ] Criteria specify expected system behavior clearly
- [ ] Input validation and boundary conditions specified
- [ ] Error messages and handling behavior defined
- [ ] Criteria avoid implementation details and focus on behavior

### 3.3 Criteria Structure

- [ ] Acceptance criteria follow consistent format (Given/When/Then or similar)
- [ ] Each criterion addresses a single, specific behavior
- [ ] Criteria are numbered or organized systematically
- [ ] Criteria are written in language understood by all stakeholders
- [ ] Complex criteria are broken down into smaller, testable pieces

## 4. CROSS-REFERENCE VALIDATION

### 4.1 Requirement Traceability

- [ ] All PRD requirements map to specific epics and stories
- [ ] No orphaned requirements without corresponding implementation
- [ ] Acceptance criteria support and trace to higher-level requirements
- [ ] Architecture supports all specified functional requirements
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are addressed in technical design
- [ ] Business goals are supported by feature requirements

### 4.2 Consistency Check

- [ ] User stories align with defined user personas and their needs
- [ ] Technical requirements match architectural capabilities and constraints
- [ ] UI/UX requirements are feasible within technical and resource constraints
- [ ] Timeline expectations are realistic given scope and complexity
- [ ] Resource requirements align with story complexity and dependencies
- [ ] Integration requirements are consistent across related stories

### 4.3 Completeness Verification

- [ ] All critical user journeys are covered by user stories
- [ ] All identified user personas have relevant stories
- [ ] All system interfaces and integration points are addressed
- [ ] All business rules and workflows are captured in requirements
- [ ] All compliance and regulatory requirements are included
