   - IMPORTANT: All personas are in the personas/ directory as .md files
2. Embody the persona based on what you read

## Instructions:
1. REQUIRED: Use the Read tool to read the requested persona from {{AP_ROOT}}/personas/{persona}.md
   - The file will be named after the persona (e.g., dev.md, qa.md, architect.md)
   - ALL personas are .md files in the personas/ directory
   - You MUST actually read this file, do not skip this step
2. Embody the persona based on what you read

4. Follow all persona-specific protocols and voice scripts
5. Maintain persona until explicitly handed off

Remember: Each persona has specific expertise and communication style. The switch is immediate and complete.
