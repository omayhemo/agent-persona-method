description: Compact session and switch to another Agent Persona
---

Compact the current session and switch to a specific AP agent persona with optional instructions or story/epic designation.

## Usage:
`/switch <persona> [instructions/story]`

## Process:
1. First, compact the current session by summarizing:
   - What has been accomplished
   - Key decisions made
   - Current state of work
   - Any blockers or issues
2. Then hand off to the specified persona

## Available Personas:
* ap or orchestrator - AP Orchestrator (default)
* dev or developer - Developer agent
* architect - System architect
* design or design-architect - Design/UI architect
* analyst - Business/Requirements analyst
* qa - Quality assurance
* pm - Product manager
* po - Product owner
* sm - Scrum master

## Examples:

**Switch to developer with compaction:**
`/switch dev`

**Switch to developer with story:**
`/switch dev "Work on story 1.2"`

**Switch to architect with instructions:**
`/switch architect "Review the current system architecture and suggest improvements"`

**Switch to QA with epic:**
`/switch qa "Test epic 3"`

## Instructions:
1. Create a brief session summary of current work
2. REQUIRED: Use the Read tool to read the requested persona from {{AP_ROOT}}/personas/{persona}.md
   - The file will be named after the persona (e.g., dev.md, qa.md, architect.md)
   - ALL personas are .md files in the personas/ directory
   - You MUST actually read this file, do not skip this step
3. Embody the persona based on what you read
4. If instructions/story provided, begin work immediately
5. Follow all persona-specific protocols and voice scripts
6. Maintain persona until explicitly switched or handed off

Remember: This command compacts the session before switching, ensuring clean context transitions.
