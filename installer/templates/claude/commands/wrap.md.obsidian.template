# Session Wrap-up Protocol

1. Create a comprehensive session summary
2. Move the current session note to archive in Obsidian
3. Update any relevant documentation

## Steps:
1. Use Obsidian MCP to find the current session note in {{SESSION_NOTES_PATH}}
   - If Obsidian is unavailable, check fallback: {{FALLBACK_SESSION_NOTES_PATH}}
2. Create a summary of what was accomplished
3. Move the note to {{ARCHIVE_PATH}} with a descriptive name
   - If using fallback, move to: {{FALLBACK_ARCHIVE_PATH}}
4. Update any relevant rules or documentation if needed

## Fallback Handling:
If Obsidian MCP is unavailable:
- Check for session notes in: {{FALLBACK_SESSION_NOTES_PATH}}
- Archive to: {{FALLBACK_ARCHIVE_PATH}}
- Sync to Obsidian when available

Remember to include:
- What was completed
- Any issues encountered
- Decisions made
- Next steps for future sessions
