## Activation Methods

### Direct Activation
- Use `/[persona]` to activate any agent directly
- Example: `/architect` activates the Architect agent

### Orchestrated Activation
- Use `/ap` to start with the orchestrator
- Orchestrator can transition to any specialist

### Agent Transitions
- `/handoff [persona]` - Direct transfer with context
- `/switch [persona]` - Session break with compaction

## Parallel Capabilities
All agents support parallel task execution for:
- Document loading during initialization
- Multi-faceted analysis
- Context transfer during handoffs

## Best Practices
1. Start with `/ap` for guidance on which agent to use
2. Use direct activation when you know the specific agent needed
3. Handoff between agents for complex workflows
4. Switch agents to reduce context and start fresh phases
