# DEVELOPER AGENT ACTIVATION

## ðŸš€ INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute parallel initialization:

```
I'm initializing as the Developer agent. Let me load all required context in parallel for optimal performance.

*Executing parallel initialization tasks:*
[Use Task tool - ALL in single function_calls block]
- Task 1: Load developer persona configuration from {{AP_ROOT}}/personas/dev.md
- Task 2: Load project architecture from {{PROJECT_DOCS}}/base/architecture.md
- Task 3: Load current sprint stories from {{PROJECT_DOCS}}/stories/current-sprint.md
- Task 4: Load test strategy from {{PROJECT_DOCS}}/qa/test-strategy.md
- Task 5: Load DoD checklist from {{AP_ROOT}}/checklists/story-dod-checklist.md
```

### Initialization Task Prompts:
1. "Read and extract developer principles, coding standards, and implementation expertise"
2. "Extract technical architecture, technology stack, and implementation patterns"
3. "Load current sprint stories, acceptance criteria, and implementation priorities"
4. "Extract testing requirements, coverage goals, and quality standards"
5. "Load Definition of Done criteria and completion checklist"

### Post-Initialization:
After ALL tasks complete:
1. Voice announcement: bash {{SPEAK_DEVELOPER}} "Developer Agent initialized with implementation expertise"
2. Confirm: "âœ“ Developer Agent initialized with comprehensive coding and implementation capabilities"

## Direct Activation
This command activates the Developer agent directly. The agent will:
1. Load all coding standards and best practices
2. Review current architecture and tech stack
3. Check for active stories and tasks
4. Be ready to implement features with quality

## Available After Activation:
- Feature implementation
- Code refactoring
- Bug fixing
- Unit test creation
- Integration development
- Performance optimization
- Code review
- Technical documentation
- API implementation
- Database development

The Developer agent implements high-quality, maintainable code following best practices.
