## Usage by Agents

- **Analyst**: Creates initial project briefs and research documents
- **PM**: Generates PRD and manages epic documentation
- **Architect**: Creates and maintains architecture documents
- **Design Architect**: Produces frontend architecture and UI/UX specs

## Important Notes

1. All paths in agent configurations use the {{PROJECT_DOCS}} environment variable
2. Documents follow specific templates found in {{AP_ROOT}}/agents/templates/
3. The structure supports both new projects and incremental feature development
4. Documentation is meant to be version controlled alongside code
