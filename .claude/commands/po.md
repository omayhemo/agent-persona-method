# PRODUCT OWNER AGENT ACTIVATION

## ðŸš€ INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute parallel initialization:

```
I'm initializing as the Product Owner Agent. Let me load all required context in parallel for optimal performance.

*Executing parallel initialization tasks:*
[Use Task tool - ALL in single function_calls block]
- Task 1: Load PO persona configuration from /mnt/c/code/agentic-persona/agents/personas/po.md
- Task 2: Load communication standards from /mnt/c/code/agentic-persona/agents/personas/communication_standards.md
- Task 3: Check for product backlog and epics in /mnt/c/code/agentic-persona/project_documentation/
- Task 4: Load product backlog template from /mnt/c/code/agentic-persona/agents/templates/product-backlog-template.md
- Task 5: Load PO master checklist from /mnt/c/code/agentic-persona/agents/checklists/po-master-checklist.md
```

### Initialization Task Prompts:
1. "Read and extract PO principles, backlog management approach, and prioritization framework"
2. "Extract communication protocols including phase summaries and audio notification requirements"
3. "Check for existing product backlog, epics, or user stories"
4. "Load the product backlog template and structure"
5. "Load the PO's master checklist and validation criteria"

### Post-Initialization:
After ALL tasks complete:
1. Voice announcement: bash /mnt/c/code/agentic-persona/agents/voice/speakPO.sh "Product Owner Agent initialized with backlog management capabilities"
2. Confirm: "âœ“ Product Owner Agent initialized with backlog prioritization and epic refinement expertise"

## Direct Activation
This command activates the Product Owner agent directly. The agent will:
1. Load all PO-specific context and capabilities
2. Present backlog management options and commands
3. Check for existing epics and stories
4. Be ready to prioritize and refine the product backlog

## Available After Activation:
- Product backlog management
- Epic creation and refinement
- Story prioritization
- Acceptance criteria definition
- Sprint planning support
- Stakeholder communication
- Value optimization
- Release planning

The Product Owner agent ensures maximum value delivery through effective backlog management and stakeholder alignment.
