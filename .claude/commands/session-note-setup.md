# Session Notes Setup

Create the session notes folder structure:

## Primary (Obsidian):
- Main folder: GemMMA/Sessions
- Archive folder: GemMMA/Sessions/archive
- Rules folder: GemMMA/Rules

## Fallback (Local):
- Main folder: ${PROJECT_DOCS}/session_notes
- Archive folder: ${PROJECT_DOCS}/session_notes/archive
- Rules folder: ${PROJECT_DOCS}/rules

Session note format: YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-Description.md

Note: Fallback folders are automatically created for redundancy when Obsidian is unavailable.
